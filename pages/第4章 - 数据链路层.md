										  old getting sometimes billion dollar or
										  有时
										  价值数十亿美元的老东西也会变得有价值。
										  multi-billion dollar valuations. Um,
										  估值高达数十亿美元。嗯，
										  which I guess could could pan out and

										  um you know, a billion people in the
										  你知道，全球有十亿人口……

										  我有点儿...
										  of curious as to why we had not sent
										  想知道为什么我们一直没有发。
										  anyone to Mars. Uh, and I went on the
										  任何载人前往火星的项目。嗯
										  然后我继续……
										  went on the NASA website to find out
										  我特意上了趟 NASA 官网去查了查。
										  when we're sending people to Mars, and
										  当我们在送人去火星的时候，以及……
										  there was no date. I thought maybe it
										  上面没有日期。我当时想也许是……
										  was just hard to find on the website.

										  Uh, but in fact, there there was no real

										  这个……
										  I think we're all listening with wrapped

										  guess maybe I'd like to do something
										  我想我大概想做点什么。
										  philanthropic in space because I didn't
										  太空慈善事业，因为我没有那样做。
										  think I could actually do anything
										  我觉得我或许真的能有所作为。
										  commercial in space because that seemed
										  太空商业化，因为那看起来……
										  like the purview of nations
										  如同国家管辖的范畴。
										  um so um but you know I'm kind of
										  嗯，所以，呃，不过你知道
										  我有点...
										  curious as to when we're going to send
										  想知道我们什么时候发货。
										  people to Mars and and that's when I was
										  将人类送上火星，那是我......
										  like oh it's not on the website and I
										  噢，好像网站上没有，然后我...
										  started digging on not there's nothing

										  on the NASA website so then I started
										  在NASA网站上，然后我就开始了。
										  digging in And um and uh and I'm I'm I'm
										  在那儿挖啊
										  然后嗯…呃…然后我…我…我…
										  definitely summarizing a lot here, but
										  这绝对是做了大量概括，不过……
										  um I I I uh my first idea was to do a
										  嗯，我，我，我，呃
										  我最初的想法是做一个……
										  philanthropic mission to Mars called

										  money shot of green plants on a red
										  在红色背景下拍摄的翠绿植物特写镜头。
										  background.
										  背景
										  Um,
										  嗯……
										  for the longest time I, by the way, I
										  這麼長時間以來，順便說一句
										  我...
										  didn't realize money shot I think is a
										  一时没反应过来
										  你说的“精彩瞬间”是指……？
										  porn reference. But, uh,
										  呃，关于那种事儿。不过，嗯……
										  but anyway, the point is that that would
										  总而言之，重点就在于那样会……
										  be the great shot of green plants on a
										  成为翠绿植物的绝佳点缀。
										  red background and to try to inspire uh,
										  鲜艳的红色背景，希望能激发一些……
										  you know, NASA and the public to to send
										  你知道的
										  美国国家航空航天局（NASA）和公众一起发射……
										  astronauts to to Mars. As I learned
										  送宇航员去火星。正如我所了解到的那样。
										  more, I I came to realize Oh, and along
										  更重要的是，我逐渐意识到…… 哦
										  还有……
										  the way, by the way, I went to Russia in
										  对了，顺便一提，我去了俄罗斯。
										  like 2001 and 2002 to buy ICBMs,
										  就像在2001年和2002年购买洲际弹道导弹一样。
										  which is like that's an adventure. You
										  这就像是一场冒险。你呢？
										  know, you go and meet with Russian high
										  你知道，你去和俄罗斯高层会面。
										  command and say, "I'd like to buy some
										  请下指令并说：“我想买一些……”
										  ICBMs." Um, this was to get to space.
										  洲际弹道导弹。"嗯
										  这是为了进入太空。
										  Yeah.
										  嗯，是/没错。
										  Not to not to nuke anyone, but
										  说真的
										  咱们还是别动不动就想着扔核弹了。
										  but they had they had to uh as a result
										  但结果就是，他们不得不……
										  of arms reduction talks, they had to
										  在裁军谈判中，他们不得不……
										  actually destroy a bunch of their their
										  狠狠地摧毁他们一堆又一堆的东西
										  big nuclear missiles.
										  大型核导弹
										  So I was like, well, how about if we
										  所以我就想，那不如我们……
										  take two of those, you know, minus the
										  就拿那两个，你知道，去掉那个...
										  nuke, um add an additional uh upper
										  核爆，嗯，加一个额外的，呃
										  上半部分。
										  stage for for Mars. Um, but it was kind
										  为登陆火星做准备。嗯，但它有点……
										  of trippy, you know, being in Moscow in
										  嗯，就是那种有点迷幻的感觉，你知道
										  在莫斯科的。
										  what 2001 negotiating with like the
										  像 2001 年那样谈判是什么感觉？
										  Russian military to buy ICVMs. Like
										  俄罗斯军方将采购步兵用火焰喷射器。 比如。
										  that's crazy.
										  这可太离谱了。
										  Um, and but they they kept also like
										  嗯
										  而且但是他们他们还一直就像...
										  raising the price on me so that so like
										  对我坐地起价，简直是……
										  literally it's kind of like the opposite
										  确切地说，它有点儿像是反过来了。
										  of what a negotiation should should do.
										  一次成功的谈判应达成的目标。
										  So I was like, man, these things are
										  哎，我就寻思着，这玩意儿...
										  getting really expensive. and and then I
										  真是越来越贵了。 而且
										  而且然后我...
										  I came to realize that actually the
										  我逐渐意识到，其实……
										  problem was not that there was
										  问题的症结并不在于...
										  insufficient will to go to Mars but that
										  缺乏前往火星的坚定意志，然而……
										  there was no way to do so without
										  除非如此，否则别无他法。
										  breaking the budget you know even
										  即使你知道会超出预算。
										  breaking the NASA budget so that's where
										  打破美国国家航空航天局（NASA）的预算
										  所以说这是资金来源。
										  I decided to start SpaceX SpaceX to uh
										  我决定成立SpaceX，嗯...
										  advance rocket technology to the point
										  将火箭技术推向新高度
										  where we could send people to Mars um
										  我们未来也许可以将人类送往火星。
										  and uh that was in 2002 so that wasn't
										  呃，那是2002年的事了
										  所以那不是……
										  you know you didn't start out uh wanting
										  你知道你一开始的时候并非是想要……
										  to start a business. You wanted to start
										  开启一番事业。 你想要开始。
										  just something that was interesting to
										  一些有趣的东西。
										  you that you thought humanity needed and
										  你认为人类需要的。
										  then as you sort of, you know, like a
										  然后，就随着你的，你知道的
										  那种...
										  cat pulling on, you know, a a string, it
										  一只猫在那儿拽着，你知道的，一根绳子
										  它...
										  just sort of the ball sort of unravels
										  感觉就像线团散开了一样。
										  and it turns out this is could be a very
										  而且结果表明，这可能非常……
										  profitable business.
										  盈利业务。
										  I mean, it it is now, but it um there I
										  我的意思是，它现在是这样，但是嗯
										  那里我...
										  there been no prior example of really a
										  确实前所未见，堪称史无前例。
										  rocket startup succeeding. There have
										  火箭创业公司取得成功。目前已经有……
										  been various attempts to do commercial
										  一直以来都有进行商业化的尝试。
										  rocket companies and they all all
										  火箭公司，以及所有其他公司。
										  failed. So um again with with SpaceX
										  失败了。所以，再说一次
										  关于SpaceX……
										  starting SpaceX was uh really from the
										  SpaceX 的创立
										  实际上源于……
										  standpoint of like I I think there's
										  我觉得，从我的角度来看，是这样。
										  like a less than 10% chance of being
										  几率不足一成
										  successful maybe 1% I don't know. Um but
										  成功的可能也就1%，我不太清楚。嗯
										  但是...
										  um but if if if a startup doesn't do
										  如果一家初创公司不这样做……
										  something to advance uh rocket
										  一些用于推进火箭的东西。
										  technology, it's definitely not coming
										  科技，那玩意儿肯定没戏了。
										  from from the big defense contractors
										  来自大型国防承包商
										  because they just impeded match to the
										  因为他们只是妨碍了比赛的进行。
										  government and the government just wants
										  政府以及政府只是希望……
										  to do very conventional things. So
										  做些很常规的事情。所以……
										  there's it's either coming from a
										  要么就是从……传来的。
										  startup or it's not happening at all.
										  要么启动，要么彻底拉倒。
										  So, so like a small chance of success is
										  这么说吧，成功的可能性微乎其微。
										  better than no chance of success and and
										  好过毫无胜算，而且。
										  so that yeah, so SpaceX
										  所以说，对，SpaceX。
										  u I started that in in mid mid 2002
										  我在2002年年中左右开始做那件事的。
										  expecting to fail. I like I said
										  预料到会失败。就像我说过的。
										  probably 90% chance of failing and even
										  十有八九会失败，甚至更糟。
										  like when recruiting people I didn't
										  就像我招人的时候，我没……
										  like try to you know make out that it
										  就像，你想，你知道，搞清楚那个。
										  would I said we're probably going to
										  我想说，我们可能要……
										  die. Uh but uh 12 chance we might not
										  哎，但也有那么一丁点儿可能
										  十二分之一的概率，我们搞砸了。
										  die and if uh but this is the only way
										  要么就此了结
										  不然…但这是唯一的办法。
										  to get people to Mars and advance the
										  将人类送上火星并推动……
										  state-of-the-art and um
										  最先进的，然后呢
										  and then uh I ended up being chief
										  然后，呃，我后来当上了主管。
										  engineer of the rocket uh not because I
										  火箭工程师，呃，倒也不是因为我。
										  wanted to but because I couldn't hire
										  本想如此，但无奈未能如愿以偿
										  因为我无法承担雇佣的成本。
										  anyone who was good. So like none of the
										  凡是出类拔萃之辈。所以，像那种……
										  good sort of chief engineers would join
										  能独当一面的总工程师才愿意加入。
										  because they're like this is too risky.
										  因为他们觉得这样做风险太大了。
										  You were going to die. And uh so then I
										  你当时就要死了。然后，嗯
										  然后我...
										  ended up being chief engineer of the
										  最终成为了……的总工程师。
										  rocket. And you know the first three
										  火箭。而且你知道前三个。
										  flights did fail. So it's a bit of a
										  航班确实失败了。所以有点……
										  learning exercise there. And um fourth
										  那里有个学习练习。嗯，第四。
										  one fortunately worked. But if the
										  幸好有一个奏效了。但如果……
										  fourth one hadn't worked uh I had no
										  第四个没成功，我没有……
										  money left and that would have been it
										  如果钱花完了，那就没戏了。
										  would have been curtains. So it was a
										  那就万事休矣。所以说
										  当时的情况真是……
										  pretty close thing. If if the fourth
										  差一点就成了。如果
										  如果第四个...
										  launch of Falcon not work, it would have
										  猎鹰发射如果失败，本应如此。
										  been just curtains and we would have
										  如果只是窗帘就好了，我们就能……
										  just been joined the graveyard of prior
										  已成昨日黄花。
										  rocket startups. So like like my
										  火箭创业公司。就是，像是，我的……
										  estimate of success was not far off. Um
										  对成功的预估八九不离十。嗯。
										  we just we made it by the skin of our
										  我们真是险之又险，才勉强成功。
										  teeth. Um
										  牙齿……嗯。
										  and um Tesla was happening sort of
										  呃，特斯拉当时也算是崭露头角吧。
										  simultaneously. Um like 2008 was a rough
										  与此同时。嗯
										  就像2008年是很艰难的一年。
										  year. Uh because at mid 2008 uh or
										  嗯，因为在2008年中期
										  或者...
										  called summer 2008 um the third the
										  可以称之为 2008 年夏季，呃
										  第三个。
										  third launch of SpaceX had failed our
										  SpaceX的第三次发射未能成功。
										  third failure in a row. Uh the Tesla
										  连续第三次失败。呃，特斯拉。
										  financing round had failed. And so Tesla
										  特斯拉的融资轮失败了。因此
										  特斯拉……
										  was going bankrupt fast. Um
										  公司正在迅速破产。 嗯。
										  it was just uh it's like man this is
										  这... 就感觉，哎，简直了。
										  grim.
										  令人沮丧的。
										  Uh this is this is going to be
										  嗯，这个嘛，接下来会是...
										  a a tale of warning of an exercise in
										  一个警示故事，一次演练。
										  hubris. Probably throughout that period
										  自负。可能在整个那段时期。
										  a lot of people were saying you know
										  很多人都在说，你知道的。
										  Elon is a software guy. Why is he
										  埃隆是个搞软件的。他怎么了？
										  working on hardware? Why would Yeah. Why
										  搞硬件？对啊，为什么这么问？
										  would he choose to work on this? Right.
										  他会选择做这个吗？当然。
										  100%. So you can look at the like the
										  百分之百。所以你可以看看
										  就比如……
										  because there still you know the press
										  因为你知道，还有媒体盯着呢。
										  of that time is still online. You could
										  那时期的内容仍然可以在网上找到。您可以...
										  just search it and and they kept calling
										  搜一下就知道了，他们一直在打电话。
										  me internet guy. Um so like internet guy
										  我是个网络弄潮儿，嗯
										  差不多就是这么个意思。
										  aka fool is attempting to build a rocket
										  就是说，有个愣头青想造火箭玩玩。
										  company. Um so um you know um
										  公司。嗯，所以，你知道……呃……
										  that we got ridiculed quite a lot. Um,
										  被人嘲笑得挺厉害的，嗯……
										  and it does sound pretty absurd like
										  而且听起来确实挺离谱的，就好像……
										  internet guy starts rocket company
										  一个搞互联网的，开始搞火箭公司了。
										  doesn't sound like a recipe for success
										  听起来不太像成功的秘诀。
										  frankly. So I don't hold it against
										  坦白说，我并不介意。
										  them. I was like, yeah, you know, it
										  他们。我就觉得，是啊，你知道的
										  就那样。
										  admittedly it does sound improbable and
										  平心而论，这听起来确实有些不可思议
										  而且…
										  I agree that it's improbable. Um,
										  嗯，我同意那可能性不大。
										  but fortunately the fourth launch worked
										  但幸运的是，第四次发射成功了。
										  and um and uh and and NASA awarded us a
										  嗯…… 呃…… 还有…… 美国国家航空航天局授予了我们一份……
										  a contract to resupply the space
										  一份为太空提供补给的合同
										  station. Uh, and I think that was like

										  maybe
										  也许吧。
										  I don't know December
										  我不知道十二月。
										  22nd or it was it was like right before
										  22号，或者应该说
										  就在那之前不久。
										  Christmas. Um, because even the fourth
										  圣诞节，嗯，甚至第四个…
										  launch working wasn't enough to succeed.
										  仅仅启动并能运行还不足以成功。
										  It NASA also needed we also needed a big
										  美国国家航空航天局需要
										  我们也需要一个大的。
										  contract to keep us alive. So, um, so I
										  一份维持我们生存的合约。嗯，所以

										  you know, what they hear. Um cuz it's
										  你知道吧，他们听到的东西。嗯
										  因为那是……
										  usually pretty, you know, sober, but I

										  但这次…
										  was like, "Man, this is a company
										  就像在说，“老天
										  这真是一家公司。”

										  So that was a nerve-wracking end of
										  真是个令人紧张的结尾。
										  2008. That's for sure. I guess from your
										  2008年
										  那是肯定的。我猜你是从你的……

										  正在招贤纳士吗？
										  Like what you know what's the salient
										  你觉得什么是重点？
										  thing that you look for or if they're
										  你所寻找的东西，或者如果他们是……
										  you know that's a different question. I
										  你知道
										  那是另外一个问题了。我...
										  guess it's I mean in terms of of of your
										  我想说
										  大概就是关于你...的意思吧。
										  end product you just have to say like
										  最终成品你只需简单地说一声就行。
										  well if this thing is successful how
										  那么，如果这事儿能成的话
										  下一步该怎么走呢？
										  useful will it be to how many people and
										  它能惠及多少人
										  以及它的实用性如何。
										  um that that's that's what I mean and
										  嗯，对，我就是这个意思。
										  and then you you do whatever you know
										  然后，就按照你所掌握的方法去做吧。
										  whether you're CEO or or any role in a
										  无论您是首席执行官还是任何其他职位
										  
										  startup you do whatever it takes to
										  在创业初期，你要竭尽全力。
										  succeed like and and just and just
										  取得成功，如虎添翼，更上一层楼。
										  always be smash smashing your ego like
										  时刻保持清醒，打破自我固执的壁垒。
										  like internalize responsibility
										  内化责任感
										  um like a major failure mode is when ego
										  一个主要的失效模式就像是自我膨胀。
										  ability ratio um is double greater than
										  能力比约为两倍以上。
										  sign one you know uh like if you if your
										  当你知道，比如说，如果你…
										  ego to ability ratio is gets too high
										  当自我膨胀远超实际能力时。
										  then you're you're you're going to
										  那么你你你就要...
										  basically break the feedback loop to
										  从根本上打破反馈回路
										  reality u and in in AI terms your your
										  现实，你，以及，在AI术语中，你的
										  你的。
										  you'll break your RL loop so you you
										  你这样会把你的强化学习循环搞砸的。
										  want you don't want to break your you
										  希望你不要打碎完整的你。
										  want to have a strong RL loop which
										  希望拥有一个强大的强化学习闭环
										  能够...
										  means internalizing responsibility and
										  意味着承担起内在的责任感。
										  minimizing ego and you do whatever the
										  task is no matter whether it's you grand
										  or humble. So, I mean, that's kind of
										  like why I actually I prefer the term
										  like engineering as opposed to research.
										  I prefer the term and and I I don't I
										  actually don't want to call XAI a lab. I
										  just want to be a company.
										  um
										  like it's like whatever the whatever the
										  simplest um most straightforward
										  uh ideally lowest ego terms are those
										  are generally a good way to go. Um to
										  you you want to just close the loop on
										  reality hard. Um that's that's a that's
										  a super big deal. I think everyone in
										  this room is uh really looks up to
										  everything you've done around being sort
										  of a paragon of first principles and you
										  know thinking about the stuff you've
										  done um how do you actually determine
										  your reality because that seems like a
										  pretty big part of it like other people
										  people who have never made anything
										  non-engineers
										  uh sometimes journalists at time who've
										  never done anything like they will
										  criticize you but then clearly you have
										  another set of people who are builders
										  who have very high you know sort of area
										  under the curve who are in your circle
										  like you know how should people approach
										  that like what has worked for you and
										  what would you pass on like you know to
										  to X to your children like you know what
										  do you tell them when you're like you
										  need to make your way in this world here
										  you know here's how to construct a
										  reality that is predictive from first
										  principles well the the tools of physics
										  are incredibly helpful
										  uh to to um understand and make progress
										  in any field. Um the first principles
										  mean just obviously just means you know
										  break things down to the fundamental
										  aimatic elements that are most likely to
										  be true and then reason up from there as
										  cogently as possible as opposed to
										  reasoning by analysis or metaphor. Um
										  and then you just simple things like
										  like thinking in the limit like if you
										  extrapolate you know minimize this thing
										  or maximize that thing thinking in the
										  limit is is very very helpful. Um I use
										  all the tools of physics. Um they apply
										  to any field.
										  Um this is like a superpower actually.
										  Um so you can take say take take for
										  example like rockets. You can say well
										  how how much should a rocket rocket
										  cost? Um the typical approach to how to
										  that people would take to how much
										  rocket should cost is they would look
										  historically at what the cost of rockets
										  are and assume that any new rocket must
										  be somewhat similar to the prior cost of
										  rockets. A first principles approach
										  would be you you look at the materials
										  that the rocket is comprised of. So if
										  that's aluminum, uh copper, carbon
										  fiber, uh steel, whatever the case may
										  be, um and say what what how much does
										  that rocket weigh and and and what are
										  the constituent elements and how much do
										  they weigh? What is the material price
										  per kilogram of those constituent
										  elements? And that sets the actual floor
										  on what a rocket uh can cost. It's it
										  can asmtoically approach the cost of the
										  raw materials. Um and then you realize
										  oh actually a rocket the raw materials
										  of a rocket are only maybe one or 2% of
										  of the historical cost of a rocket. So
										  the manufacturing must necessarily be
										  very inefficient um if the if the raw
										  material cost is only 1 or 2%. That
										  would be a first first principles
										  analysis of the potential for the cost
										  for cost optimization of a rocket. And
										  that's before you get to reusability.
										  You know to give an AI sort of AI
										  example I guess uh last year where for
										  XEI when we were trying to build a a
										  training supercluster
										  uh we we we went to the various
										  suppliers to ask
										  said this was beginning of last year
										  that we needed 100,000 H100s to be able
										  to train coherently. Um and uh their
										  estimates for how long it would take to
										  complete that were 18 to 24 months. It's
										  like well we need to get that done in 6
										  months. So then um or we won't be
										  competitive. So so then uh if you break
										  that down what well what are the things
										  you need? Well, you need a building, you
										  need power, you need cooling.
										  Um we didn't have enough time to build a
										  building from scratch. So we had to find
										  an existing building. So, we found a a
										  factory that was no longer in use in
										  Memphis that used to build Electrolux
										  products. Um, but then the the input
										  power was 15 megawatts and we needed 150
										  megawatt. So, uh we we um rented
										  generators and had generators on one
										  side of the building and then we have to
										  have cooling. So, we rented about a
										  quarter of the mobile cooling capacity
										  of the US and put the the chillers on
										  the other side of the building.
										  uh that didn't fully solve the problem
										  because the voltage v the power
										  variations during training um are are
										  very g very big. So you can have power
										  can drop by 50% in 100 milliseconds
										  which the generators can't keep up with.
										  So then we combi we added Tesla mega
										  packs and modified the software in the
										  mega packs to be able to to smooth out
										  the uh the power variation during the
										  training run. Um, and then there were
										  there were a bunch of network networking
										  challenges. Um, because the networking
										  cables if you're trying to make 100,000
										  GPUs train coherently are very very
										  challenging. Um, almost it sounds like
										  uh almost any of those things you
										  mentioned uh I could imagine someone
										  telling you very directly, no, you can't
										  have that, you can't have that power,
										  you can't have this. Uh, and it sounds
										  like one of the salient pieces of first
										  principles thinking is actually let's
										  ask why. let's, you know, figure that
										  out and actually let's challenge the
										  person across the table and if they if I
										  don't get an answer that I feel good
										  about, I'm gonna, you know, not allow
										  that to be I'm not going to let that
										  know to stand. Is that I mean, that
										  feels like something that, you know,
										  everyone, if someone were to try to do
										  what you're doing in hardware, hardware
										  seems to uniquely need this. In
										  software, we have lots of, you know,
										  fluff and things that, you know, it's
										  like we can add more CPUs to that. it'll
										  be fine. But in hardware, it's it's just
										  not going to work. I think these general
										  principles of first principle thinking
										  apply to software and hardware apply to
										  anything really. Um I'm just using kind
										  of a hardware example um of of how we
										  were told something is impossible, but
										  once we broke it down into the
										  constituent elements of we need a
										  building, we need power, we need
										  cooling, we need uh we we need power
										  smoothing and then and then we could
										  solve those constituent elements. Um but
										  it it was and then we and then we just
										  ran the the networking operation to to
										  do all the cabling everything um in four
										  shifts 247 and and I was like sleeping
										  in the data center and also doing
										  cabling myself. Um and and there were a
										  lot of other issues to solve. Um you
										  know nobody had done a training run with
										  100,000
										  um H100s training coherently last year.
										  May maybe it's been done this year. I
										  don't know.
										  Um and then and then we ended up
										  doubling that uh to 200,000. And so now
										  we we've got 150,000 H100s, 50K H200s,
										  and 30K GB200s
										  um in the in the Memphis uh training
										  center. And we're about to bring 110,000
										  GB200s online um at a second data center
										  also in the Memphis area. Is it your
										  view that you know uh pre-training is
										  still working and you know larger the
										  scaling laws still hold and whoever wins
										  this race will have basically the
										  biggest smartest possible model that you
										  could distill?
										  Well, there's other various elements
										  that
										  um beside competitiveness for for large
										  AI um there's there's for sure the the
										  talent of the people matter. Um the
										  scale of the hardware matters and how
										  well you able to bring that hardware to
										  bear. So you can't just order a whole
										  bunch of GPUs and they they don't you
										  can't just plug them in. So you've got
										  to you've got to get a lot of GPUs and
										  have them um train trained coherently
										  and stably. Um then it's like what
										  unique access to data do you have? I
										  guess distribution matters to some
										  degree as well like how do people get
										  exposed to your AI? Those are those are
										  critical factors for if it's going to be
										  like a large foundation model that's
										  competitive. Um
										  um you know as um as many have said I
										  think my friend I sky said uh you know
										  we've kind of run out of pre-training
										  data of human generated pre like human
										  generated data you run out of tokens
										  pretty fast um of certainly of high
										  quality tokens
										  and um
										  and then you and you have to do
										  a lot of uh you you need to essentially
										  create synthetic data
										  um and and be able to accurately judge
										  the synthetic data that you're creating
										  to verify like is this real synthetic
										  data or is it an hallucination that
										  doesn't actually match reality. Um so
										  achieving grounding in reality is is is
										  tricky but but we we are at the stage
										  where
										  there's more effort put into synthetic
										  data. Um and like right now we're we're
										  training Grock 3.5 which is a a heavy
										  focus on reasoning. Going back to your
										  physics point, uh what I heard for
										  reasoning is that uh hard science
										  particularly physics textbooks are very
										  useful for reasoning whereas um I think
										  researchers have told me that social
										  science is totally useless for
										  reasoning.
										  Uh yes, that's probably true. Um so yeah
										  um you know something that's going to be
										  very important in the future is um
										  combining deep AI uh in the the data
										  center or supercluster with robotics.
										  Uh so that uh you know things like like
										  the Optimus humanoid robot and um yeah
										  Optimus is awesome. There's going to be
										  so many humanoid robots and and robots
										  of all robots of all sizes and shapes,
										  but my prediction is that there will be
										  more humanoid robots by far than all
										  other robots combined by maybe an order
										  of magnitude like a a big difference. Um
										  and um is it true that you you're
										  planning a robot army of a sort? Whether
										  we do it or or or you know whether Tesla
										  does it, you know, Tesla works closely
										  with XAI. Um,
										  like you've seen how many humanoid robot
										  startups are there. Like it's like I
										  think Jensen Bong was on stage with a
										  lot with a massive number of robots, you
										  know, robots from different companies. I
										  think there was like dozen different
										  humanoid robots.
										  So, I mean, I guess, you know, part of
										  what I've been fighting and maybe what
										  has slowed me down somewhat is that I'm
										  a I'm a little I don't want I don't want
										  to make Terminator real, you know. So,
										  I've been sort of I guess at least until
										  recent years dragging my feet on on AI
										  and and humanoid robotics.
										  And then I sort of come to the realiz
										  realization it's it's happening whether
										  I do it or not. So, you got really two
										  choices. Particip you could either be a
										  spectator or a participant. And so,
										  like, well, I guess I'd rather be a
										  participant than a spectator.
										  Um so now it's you know pedal to the
										  metal on humanoid robots and um
										  digital super intelligence. So I guess
										  you know there's a third thing that uh
										  everyone has heard you talk a lot about
										  that I'm really a big fan of you know
										  becoming a multilanetary species. Where
										  does this fit? You know this is all you
										  know not not just a 10 or 20 year thing
										  maybe a hundredyear thing like it's a
										  mult you know many many generations for
										  humanity kind of thing. You know
										  how do you think about it? There's, you
										  know, AI, obviously, there's embodied
										  robotics, and then there's being a
										  multip multilanetary species. Does
										  everything sort of feed into that last
										  point or, you know, what what are you
										  driven by right now for the next 10, 20,
										  and 100 years? Jeez, 100 years, man. I
										  hope civilization's around in 100 years.
										  If if it is around, it's going to look
										  very different from civilization today.
										  Um, I mean, I'd predict that there's
										  going to be
										  at least five times as many humanoid
										  robots as there are humans, maybe 10
										  times.
										  Um,
										  and one way to look at the progress of
										  civilization is percentage completion
										  kadesv. So, if you're, you know,
										  cautious of scale one, you've um, you've
										  harnessed all the energy of a planet.
										  Now in in my opinion we've only uh
										  harnessed maybe 1 or 2% of uh earth's
										  energy. Uh so we've got a long way to go
										  to the cev scale one. Uh then car shift
										  2 you've harnessed all the energy of a
										  sun. Uh which would be I don't know a
										  billion times more energy than earth
										  maybe closer to a trillion. Um and then
										  kv 3 would be all the energy of a galaxy
										  pretty far from that.
										  So
										  we're at the very very early stage of
										  the intelligence big bang. I I I hope I
										  hope we're on the in terms of being
										  multilanetary like I think
										  I think we'll have enough mass
										  transferred to Mars within like roughly
										  30 years to make Mars self- sustaining
										  such that Mars can continue to grow and
										  prosper even if the resupply ships from
										  Earth stop coming. Um and that that
										  greatly increases the probable lifespan
										  of civilization or or consciousness or
										  intelligence both biological and
										  digital.
										  Um so that's why I think it's important
										  to become a multilanet species. And I'm
										  somewhat troubled by the foamy paradox
										  like why have we not seen any aliens?
										  And it could be because intelligence is
										  incredibly rare. Um and maybe we're the
										  only ones in this galaxy. Um in which
										  case the intelligence of consciousness
										  is this like tiny candle in a vast
										  darkness and we should do everything
										  possible to ensure the tiny candle
										  candle does not go out and being a
										  multilanet species or making
										  consciousness multilanetary
										  uh greatly improves the probable
										  lifespan of civilization and it's it's
										  it's the next step before going to other
										  star systems. Um once you once you at
										  least have two planets, then you've got
										  a forcing function for the improvement
										  of space travel. Um and um and that that
										  ultimately is what will lead to
										  uh consciousness expanding to the stars.
										  It could be that um the Fermy paradox
										  dictates once you get to some level of
										  technology, you destroy yourself. How do
										  we say ourselves? How do we actually
										  what would you prescribe to I mean a
										  room full of engineers like what can we
										  do to prevent that from happening? Yeah.
										  How do we avoid the great filters? One
										  of the great filters would obviously be
										  global thermonuclear war. Uh
										  so we should try to avoid that. Um, I
										  guess building benign AI robots that AI
										  that loves humanity and um,
										  you know, robots that are helpful. Um,
										  something that I think is uh, extremely
										  important in building AI is is a very
										  rigorous adherence to truth even if that
										  truth is politically incorrect.
										  Um I my intuition for what could make AI
										  very dangerous is if um if you force AI
										  to believe things that are not true. How
										  do you think about you know there's sort
										  of this argument for open uh open for
										  safety versus closed for competitive
										  edge. I mean I think the great thing is
										  you have a competitive model. Many other
										  people also have competitive models. And
										  in that sense, you know, we're sort of
										  off of maybe the worst timeline that I'd
										  be worried about is, you know, there's
										  fast takeoff and it's only in one
										  person's hands. You know, that might,
										  you know, sort of collapse uh a lot of
										  things. Whereas now we have choice,
										  which is great. How do you think about
										  this? Yeah, I do think there will be
										  several
										  deep intelligences, may maybe at least
										  five.
										  Um
										  maybe as much as 10.
										  Um,
										  I'm not sure that there's going to be
										  hundreds, but it's probably close to
										  like maybe there'll be like 10 or
										  something like that. Um, of which maybe
										  four will be in the US.
										  Um,
										  so
										  I I don't think it's going to be any one
										  AI that that has a runaway
										  capability. Um
										  but but yeah se several deep
										  intelligences. What will these deep deep
										  intelligences actually be doing? Will it
										  be scientific research or trying to hack
										  each other?
										  Probably all of the above.
										  Um
										  I mean hopefully they will discover new
										  physics and I think they will very
										  they're they're definitely going to
										  invent new technologies.
										  Um
										  like I think I think we're quite close
										  to digital super intelligence.
										  It may happen this year and if it
										  doesn't happen this year, next year for
										  sure a digital super intelligence
										  defined as smarter than any human at
										  anything. Well, so how do we direct that
										  to sort of super abundance? You know, we
										  have we could have robotic labor, we
										  have cheap energy, intelligence on
										  demand. you know, is that sort of the
										  white pill? Like where do you sit on the
										  spectrum? And are there tangible things
										  that you would encourage everyone here
										  to be working on to make that white pill
										  actually reality?
										  I think I think it most likely will be a
										  good outcome. Um I I guess I'd sort of
										  agree with Jeff Hinton that maybe it's a
										  10 to 20% chance of annihilation. Uh but
										  look on the bright side, that's 80 to
										  90% probability of a great outcome. Um,
										  so
										  yeah, I can't emphasize this enough. A
										  rigorous adherence to truth
										  uh is is the most important thing for AI
										  safet safety. Um,
										  and obviously empathy for uh humanity
										  and life as we know it. We haven't uh
										  talked about Neurolink and uh at all
										  yet, but I'm curious, you know, you're
										  working on closing the input and output
										  gap between humans and machines. Uh how
										  critical is that to AGI ASI? And you
										  know, once that link is made, can we not
										  only read but also write the neural link
										  is not necessary to solve um digital
										  super intelligence. Uh that'll happen
										  before neural link is at scale. Uh but
										  uh what Nurolink can effectively do is
										  solve the um the input output bandwidth
										  constraints. Especially our output con
										  bandwidth is very low. The the out the
										  the sustained output of a human over the
										  course of a day is less than one bit per
										  second. So there, you know, 86,400
										  seconds in a day. Um and is extremely
										  rare for a human to output more than
										  that number of symbols per day. So
										  um certainly for several days in a row.
										  Uh so you you really um with with a with
										  a neural link interface you can
										  massively increase your output bandwidth
										  and your input bandwidth. Um input being
										  right to you you have to do write
										  operations to the brain. Um we um we
										  have now five humans who have received
										  the uh the kind of the read uh input
										  where it's reading signals. And you've
										  got people with with ALS who um really
										  have no they're tetroplegics, but they
										  they can now communicate at with with at
										  um similar bandwidth to a human with a
										  fully functioning body um and control
										  their computer and phone um which is
										  pretty cool. And then um I think in the
										  next 6 to 12 months we'll be doing our
										  first implants for vision where even if
										  somebody's completely blind um uh we we
										  can write directly to um the uh the
										  visual cortex um and and we've had that
										  working in monkeys actually. I think one
										  of our monkeys now has had a visual
										  implant for three years and um at first
										  it'll be relatively fairly low
										  resolution but long term you would have
										  very high resolution and be able to see
										  multisspectral
										  wavelengths. So uh you could see an
										  infrared ultraviolet radar like a
										  superpower situation like at at at some
										  point the cybernetic implants wouldn't
										  would not simply be correcting things
										  that went wrong but uh augmenting human
										  capabilities dramatically
										  augmenting augmenting intelligence and
										  senses and bandwidth uh dramatically and
										  that's that's going to happen at some
										  point. Um
										  but digital super intelligence will
										  happen well before that
										  at least if we have a a neural link we
										  might we'll be able to appreciate the
										  the AI better I guess one of the
										  limiting reagents to all of your efforts
										  across all of these different domains is
										  access to the smartest possible people.
										  Um, yes. But, you know, sort of
										  simultaneous to that we have, you know,
										  the rocks can talk and reason and, you
										  know, they're maybe 130 IQ now and
										  they're probably going to be super
										  intelligent soon. Uh, how do you
										  reconcile those two things? Like what's
										  going to happen in you know 5 10 years
										  and what should the people in this room
										  do to uh make sure that, you know,
										  they're the ones who are creating
										  instead of maybe below the API line?
										  Well, they call it the singularity for a
										  reason because we don't know what's
										  going to happen in in the not that far
										  future. The percentage of intelligence
										  that is human will be quite small. At
										  some point, the collective sum of human
										  intelligence will be less than 1% of all
										  intelligence.
										  Um
										  and if if things get to a cauter ship
										  level two
										  um we're talking about
										  human intelligence even assuming a
										  significant increase in human population
										  and intelligence augmentation like
										  massive intelligence augmentation where
										  like everyone has an IQ of a thousand
										  type of thing. Um even in that
										  circumstance uh collective human
										  intelligence will be probably 1
										  billionth that of uh digital
										  intelligence. Anyway, where's the
										  biological bootloader for digital super
										  intelligence? I guess just to end off
										  was I he was like was I a good
										  bootloader. Where do we go? How do we go
										  from here? I mean I mean all of this is
										  pretty wild sci-fi stuff that also could
										  be built by the people in this room.
										  You know, if you do you have a closing
										  thought for the smartest technical
										  people of this generation right now,
										  what should they be doing? What should
										  they what should they be working on?
										  What should they be thinking about, you
										  know, tonight as they go to dinner?
										  Well,
										  I as I started off with, I think if
										  you're doing something useful, that's
										  great. Um,
										  if you just just try to be as useful as
										  possible to your fellow human beings and
										  that that then you're doing something
										  good. Um, I keep harping on this like
										  focus on super truthful AI that that's
										  the most important thing for AI safety.
										  Um,
										  you know, obviously if you know um
										  anyone's interested in working at XAI, I
										  mean, please please let us know. Um
										  we're aiming to make gro um the
										  maximally truth seeeking AI. Um and uh I
										  think that's a very important thing. Um
										  hopefully we can understand the nature
										  of the universe. That that's really I
										  guess what AI can hopefully tell us.
										  Maybe AI AI can maybe tell us where are
										  the aliens and what you know how did the
										  universe really start? How will it end?
										  What are the questions that we don't
										  know that we should ask?
										  And um
										  are we in a simulation or what level of
										  simulation are we in?
										  Well, I think we're going to find out.
										  An NPC.
